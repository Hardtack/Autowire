    Convert implementation to shared resource implementation.

    Shared resource shares context using reference counting.
    When you try to resolve shared resource that already resolve but not teared
    down, It brings previously resolved resouce. ::

                yield "üê∂"

            print(message)
            with context.resolve(dog) as dog_value:
                print("Feeding {}".format(dog_value))

        # Output:
        # Dog is entering
        # Walking with üê∂

        # Dog leaved

    When set globally to `True` the resource will be shared globally.
    "Globally shared" means resource is shared in providing context.

    Globally shared resource will be tied into resource's providing context.
    It means that children's context will not be able to be used
    in this resource. ::

        res1 = Resource('res1', __name__)
        res2 = Resource('res2', __name__)

        @res2.implement
        @shared(globally=True)

            with context.resolve(res2) as res1_factory:
                res1 = res1_factory()
                try:
                    yield res1
                finally:
                    res1.teardown()

        # res2. Because res1 was shared globally in parent¬†context.
